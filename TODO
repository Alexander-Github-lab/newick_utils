nw_ed has problems when deleting a node (try valgrind nw_ed data/HRV_bs.nw 'i & b == 13' d). The illegal write happens when destroying a list that is apparently not correctly terminated, i.e. l->count == 1 but l->head->next is not NULL as it should be. I'm not sure exactly when this occurs yet (destroy_llist() is used frequently).
