The Newick Utilities are a suite of programs for working with Newick-formatted
phylogenetic trees.

See INSTALL for installing. The package uses the GNU autotools, so basically,
it's the familiar

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install

There are no fancy options. 

You need a C compiler (C99; I use GCC). You also need Flex and Bison, but
chances are they're already installed if you have GCC.

MacOS users need to install Xcode. Some spurious error messages may be
reported, and a nw_gen test may fail - AFAICT this is due to differences in the
random number generators between MacOS and Linux.
