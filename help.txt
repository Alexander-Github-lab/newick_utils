Orders nodes by alphabetical order

Synopsis
--------

%s [-h] <newick trees filename|->

Input
-----

Argument is the name of a file that contains Newick trees, or '-' (in
which case trees are read from standard input).

Output
------

Orders the tree and prints it out on standard output. The ordering field is the
node's label for leaves, or the first child's order field for inner nodes. The
tree's topology is not altered: the biological information contained in the
tree is left intact.

This is useful for comparing trees, because isomorphic trees will yield
different Newick representations if the nodes are ordered differently.

Options
-------

    -h: print this message and exit

Examples
--------

# These two trees look different...
$ diff -q data/falconiformes data/falconiformes_2 
Files data/falconiformes and data/falconiformes_2 differ

# but are they really?
$ nw_order data/falconiformes > f1
$ nw_order data/falconiformes_2 > f2

# No, they're in fact the same
$ diff -s f1 f2
Files f1 and f2 are identical
