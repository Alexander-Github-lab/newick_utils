I'm trying to get the Git repository to be better than what it was when I was
using Subversion - not that it was a problem with Subversion per se, it's just
that I've embarked on a big change, so I might as well try and fix this while
I'm at it.

Basiclly, I want only the source files to be in the repository: anything that
can be generated should not be there, because i) it's  a waste of space, and
ii) local versions may conflict.

The idea is, then, that after doing a git clone, you should just need to run
./configure -- since this is what happens when you compile from source.

So, my repository being in an unknown state, I did:

$ autoreconf --install

which should make it ./configure - runnable. Then I did

$ ./configure && make check

All went smoothly, so

$ make distclean.

This I'll use as a starting point.
