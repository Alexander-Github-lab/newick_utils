\section{Extracting Distances}

There are many ways of defining distances in a tree. First, we have to consider
whether the tree is a cladogram or a phylogram: in the former case, the
distances will be measured in whatever units the tree was built with (usually
substitutions per site), in the latter, it will just be the number of ancestors.

Then we can measure distance in a variety of ways. This is the job of
\distance. By default, it prints the distance from the root of the tree to all
labeled leaves, in the order in which they appear in the Newick. Let's look at
distances in the monkeys tree:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{dspl_svg1_svg.pdf}
\end{center}

\verbatiminput{dist_1_txt.cmd}
\begin{samepage}
\verbatiminput{dist_1_txt.out}
\end{samepage}
This means that the distance from the root to \texttt{Gorilla} is 56, etc. Option \texttt{-n} shows the labels:
\verbatiminput{dist_2_txt.cmd}
\begin{samepage}
\verbatiminput{dist_2_txt.out}
\end{samepage}

There are two main parameters to \distance: the \emph{method} and the
\emph{selection}. The method determines how to compute the distance (from what
node to what node), and the selection determines for which nodes the program is
to compute distances. Let's look at examples.

\subsection{Selection}

In this section we will show the different selections, using the default
distance method. The selection type is the argument to option \texttt{-s}.
The nodes appear in the same order as in the Newick tree, except when they are
specified on the command line (see below).

To illustrate the selection types, we need a tree that has both labeled and
unlabeled leaves and inner nodes. Here it is in Newick format (I indented it
with \nwindent{} - see \ref{sct_indent}):
\verbatiminput{dist_sel_xpl.nw}
And here it is in graphical form:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{dist_3_svg.pdf}
\end{center}
We will use option \texttt{-n} to see the node labels.

\subsubsection{All labeled leaves}

The selection consists of all leaves with a label. This is the default, as
leaves will mostly be labeled and we're generally more interested in leaves
than inner nodes.
\verbatiminput{dist_4_txt.cmd}
\verbatiminput{dist_4_txt.out}

\subsubsection{All labeled nodes}

Option \texttt{-s l}. This takes all labeled nodes into account, whether they are leaves or inner nodes.
\verbatiminput{dist_5_txt.cmd}
\verbatiminput{dist_5_txt.out}

\subsubsection{All leaves}

Option \texttt{-s f}. Selects all leaves, whether they are
labeled or not.
\verbatiminput{dist_6_txt.cmd}
\verbatiminput{dist_6_txt.out}

\subsubsection{All nodes}

Option \texttt{-s a}. All nodes are selected.
\verbatiminput{dist_7_txt.cmd}
\verbatiminput{dist_7_txt.out}

\subsubsection{Command line selection}

The selection consists of the nodes whose labels are passed as arguments on
the command line (after the file name). 
\verbatiminput{dist_8_txt.cmd}
\verbatiminput{dist_8_txt.out}

\subsection{Methods}

In this section we will take the default selection and vary the method. The
method is te argument to option \texttt{-m}.

\subsubsection{Distance from the Tree's Root}

This is the default method: for each node in the selection, the program prints
the distance from the tree's root to the node. This was shown above, so I
won't repeat it here.

\subsubsection{Distance from last common ancestor}
