\section{Pruning}
\label{sct_prune}

Pruning is simply removing arbitrary nodes. Say you have the following tree:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{prune_1_svg.pdf}
\end{center}

\noindent{}and say you only need a subset of the species, perhaps because you
want to compare this tree to another tree with fewer species. Specifically,
let's say you don't need to show \textit{Tetraodon}, \textit{Danio},
\textit{Bombina}, and \textit{Didelphis}. You just pass those labels to
\prune:

\verbatiminput{prune_2_svg.cmd}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{prune_2_svg.pdf}
\end{center}

\noindent{}Note that each label is removed individually. The discarding of
\textit{Didelphis} is the cause of the disappearance of the node labeled
Mammalia.

You can also discard internal nodes, if they are labeled (in future versions
it will be possible to discard a clade by specifying descendants, just like
\clade). For example, you can discard the whole mammalian clade like this:

\verbatiminput{prune_3_svg.cmd}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{prune_3_svg.pdf} 
\end{center}

By the way, \textit{Tetrao} and \textit{Tetraodon} are not the same thing, the
first is a bird (grouse), the second is a pufferfish.
