Most of the changes are "behind the scenes", but we can mention:

simpler, more stable and marginally faster)

\section{Version 1.5}

\startitemize
\item Can use \libxml{} to make better graphics (currently used only for radial
trees, see \in{}[sct:display:libxml]).
\item \sched{}-- a reimplementation of \ed{} that embeds a Scheme interpreter
(\gnu{} Guile).
\item \code{to\_newick\_i()} -- an {\em iterative} function for getting the
Newick representation of a tree, but that {\em returns} the Newick instead of dumping it to stdout.
\item parser no longer chokes on \code{/}s
\item many other bug fixes
\item many new tests
