\chapter{Installing the \nutils}

\section{From source}

I have tested the \nutils{} on various distributions of Linux, as well as on
Mac OS X and Cygwin\footnote{I use Linux as a main development platform.
Although I try my best to get the package to compile on Macs and Cygwin, I don't
always succeed.}. On Linux, chances are you already have development tools
preinstalled, but some distributions (\eg, Ubuntu) do not install \textsc{gcc},
etc. by default. Check that you have \textsc{gcc}, Bison, Flex, and the
\textsc{gnu} autotools, including Libtool. The same goes for Cygwin. On MacOS X,
you need to install XCode (\url{http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode}).
Here are the versions I use (as reported by passing \texttt{--version} to the
program):

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Autoconf	& autoconf (GNU Autoconf) & 2.63 \\
Automake	& automake (GNU automake) & 1.11.1 \\
Bison  		& bison (GNU Bison) 			& 2.4.1 \\ 
Flex			& flex 										& 2.5.35 \\
GCC 			& gcc (GCC) 							& 4.4.1 20090725 (Red Hat 4.4.1-2) \\
Libtool		& ltmain.sh (GNU libtool) & 2.2.6b \\
Make			& GNU Make 								& 3.81
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\noindent{}The package uses the \textsc{gnu} autotools, like many other open source
software packages. So all you need to do is the usual
\begin{verbatim}
$ tar xzf newick-utils-x.y.z.tar.gz
$ cd newick-utils-x.y.z
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
# make install
\end{verbatim}
The \texttt{make check} is optional, but you should try it anyway. Note that
the \gen{} test may fail - this is due to differences in pseudo-random number
generators, as far as I can tell.


\section{As binaries}

Since version 1.1, there are also binary distribution for some platforms. The
name of the archive matches \texttt{newick-utils-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz}.
All you need to do is:

\begin{verbatim}
$ tar xzf newick-utils-<vesion>-<platform>.tar.gz
$ cd newick-utils-<vesion>-<platform>
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}The binaries are in \texttt{src}. Testing may be less important than
when installing from source, but you can do it like this:

\begin{verbatim}
$ cd tests
$ for test in test*.sh; do ./$test; done 
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}any failure will generate a \texttt{FAIL} message (which you could filter with \texttt{grep}, etc).  You can then copy/move the binaries wherever it suits you.
