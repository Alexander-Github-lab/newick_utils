\chapter{Installing the \nutils}

I have tested the \nutils{} on various distributions of Linux, as well as on
Mac OS X. On Linux, chances are you already have development tools
preinstalled, but some distributions (\eg, Ubuntu) do not install \textsc{gcc},
etc. by default. Check that you have \textsc{gcc},
Bison, Flex, and the \textsc{gnu} autotools. On MacOS X, you just need to
install XCode (\url{http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode}). 

The package uses the \textsc{gnu} autotools, like many other open source
software packages. So all you need to do is the usual
\begin{verbatim}
$ tar xzf newick-utils-x.y.z.tar.gz
$ cd newick-utils-x.y.z
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
# make install
\end{verbatim}
The \texttt{make check} is optional, but you should try it anyway.
