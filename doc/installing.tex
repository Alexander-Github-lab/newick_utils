\chapter{Installing the \nutils}

The \nutils{} use the \textsc{gnu} autotools, like many other open source
software packages. So all you need to do is
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
# make install
\end{verbatim}
at the top of the distribution directory. The \texttt{make check} is optional, but you should try it anyway.
