Although the \nutils{} are primarily intended for shell use, it is also
possible to use (some of) their functionalities in Python programs\footnote{Or
C programs, for that matter: the app code is well separated from the library
code, which can serve as an \textsc{api}}. While the \nutils{} are written in
C, the \texttt{ctypes} module\footnote{Available in Python 2.5 and up} makes it
easy to access them from Python, and the distribution contains a module,
\texttt{newick\_utils.py}, that provides an object-oriented interface to the
underlying C code.

Let's say we want to add a utility that prints simple statistics about trees,
like the number of nodes, the depth, whether it is a cladogram or a phylogram,
etc. We will call it \texttt{nw\_info.py}, and we'll pass it a \nw{}
file on standard input, so the usage will be something like:

\begin{verbatim}
$ nw_info.py < data/catarrhini
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}The overall structure of this program is simple: iteratively read
all the input trees, and do something with each of them:

\begin{lstlisting}
from newick_utils import *

for tree in Tree.parse_newick_input():
    pass # process tree here!
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent{}Line 1 imports definitions from the \texttt{newick\_utils.py}
module. Line 3 is the main loop: the \texttt{Tree.parse\_newick\_input}
reads standard input and yields an instance of class \texttt{Tree} for each
Newick string. We can now work with it, using methods of class \texttt{Tree} or adding our own:

\lstinputlisting{../src/nw_info.py}

\noindent{}When we run the program, we get:

\verbatiminput{python_1_txt.cmd}
\verbatiminput{python_1_txt.out}

As you can see, most of the work is done by methods called on the \texttt{tree}
object, such as \texttt{get\_leaf\_count} which (surprise!) returns the number
of leaves of a tree. But since there is no method for counting polytomies, we
added our own function, \texttt{count\_polytomies}, which takes a \texttt{Tree}
object as argument.

As another example, a simple implementation of \reroot{} is found in
\texttt{src/nw\_reroot.py}. Its performance is almost as good as \reroot{}'s,
especially on large input.

\section{API Documentation}

\noindent{}Detailed information about all classes and methods available for accessing the \nutils{} library from Python is found in file \texttt{newick\_utils.py}. Note that the library must be installed on your system, which means that you must compile from source.
