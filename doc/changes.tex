\chapter{Changes}

The base version was 1.3.5, the first one that was published. Changes are
relative to the previous one, or to v. 1.3.5. Minor changes (that don't affect
the user at all) are not listed.

\section{Version 1.6}

Most of the changes are "behind the scenes", but we can mention:

\begin{itemize}
\item \luaed, a re-implementation of \ed{} that uses Lua.
\item refactoring (especially of \texttt{struct rnode} that make the code
simpler, more stable and marginally faster)
\end{itemize}

\section{Version 1.5}

\begin{itemize}
\item Can use \libxml{} to make better graphics (currently used only for radial
trees, see \ref{sct:display:libxml}).
\item \sched{}-- a reimplementation of \ed{} that embeds a Scheme interpreter
(\gnu{} Guile).
\item \texttt{to\_newick\_i()} -- an \emph{iterative} function for getting the
Newick representation of a tree, but that \emph{returns} the Newick instead of dumping it to stdout.
\item parser no longer chokes on \texttt{/}s
\item many other bug fixes
\item many new tests
\end{itemize}
