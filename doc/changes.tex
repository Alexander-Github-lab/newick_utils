\section{Version 1.5}

\begin{itemize}
\item Can use \libxml{} to make better graphics (currently used only for radial
trees, see \ref{sct:display:libxml}).
\item \sched{}-- a reimplementation of \ed{} that embeds a Scheme interpreter
(\gnu{} Guile).
\item \texttt{to\_newick\_i()} -- an \emph{iterative} function for getting the
Newick representation of a tree, but that \emph{returns} the Newick instead of dumping it to stdout.
\item parser no longer chokes on \texttt{/}s
\item many other bug fixes
\item many new tests
\end{itemize}
