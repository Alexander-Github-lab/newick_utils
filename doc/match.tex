\section{Matching subtrees}
\label{sct_match}

\match{} tries to match a (smaller) "pattern" tree to the target tree(s). If
the pattern matches the target, the target tree is printed. This is typically
used to select trees that match a certain structure. For example, file
\texttt{hominoidea.nw} contains seven trees corresponding to successive
theories about the phylogeny of apes. We wish to know which of them group humans and chimpanzees as a sister clade of gorillas (which is the current hypothesis).
