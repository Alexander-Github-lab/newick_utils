\section[sct_gen]{Generating Random Trees}


\gen{} generates clock-like random trees, with exponentially distributed branch
lengths. Nodes are sequentially labeled.

\svgCmdOutput{gen_1}

Here I pass option \code{-s}, whose argument is the pseudo-random number
generator's seed, so that I get the same tree every time I produce this
document. Normally, you will not use it if you want a different tree every
time.  Other options are \code{-d}, which specifies the tree's depth, and
\code{-l}, which sets the average branch length.

I use random trees to test the other applications, and also as a kind of null
model to test to what extent a real tree departs from the null hypothesis.
