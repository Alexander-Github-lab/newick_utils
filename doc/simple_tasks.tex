\chapter{Simple Tasks}
\label{chap_simple}

The tasks shown in this chapter all involve a single \nutils{} program (plus
possibly \display). This can hence also be thought of as an introduction to
each individual program. The tasks are ordered roughly by frequency, meaning
that the most common tasks come first.

\input{display}

\input{reroot}

\input{clade}

\input{condense}

\input{prune}

\input{indent}

\input{labels}
