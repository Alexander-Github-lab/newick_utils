\chapter{Defining Clades by their Descendants}
\label{sct_def_clades}

When you need to specify a clade using the \nutils{}, you either give the label
of the clade's root, or the labels of (some of) its descendants. Since inner
nodes rarely have labels (or worse, have unuseable labels like bootstrap
support values), you will often need to specify clades by their descendants.
Consider the following tree:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{clade_2_svg.pdf} 
\end{center}

\noindent{}Suppose we want to specify the Hominoidea clade - the apes. It is
the clade that contains \texttt{Homo}, \texttt{Pan} (chimps), \texttt{Gorilla},
\texttt{Pongo} (orangutan), and \texttt{Hylobates} (gibbons). The clade is not
labeled in this tree, but this list of labels defines it without ambiguity. In
fact, we can define it unambiguously using just \texttt{Hylobates} and
\texttt{Homo} - or \texttt{Hylobates} and any other label. The point is that
\emph{you never need more than two labels to unambiguously define a clade}.

You cannot choose any two nodes, however: the condition is that the last
common ancestor of the two nodes be the root of the desired clade. For
instance, if you used \texttt{Pongo} instead of \texttt{Hylobates}, you would
define the Hominidae clade, leaving out the gibbons.

\section{Why not just use node numbers?}

Some applications atribute numbers to all inner nodes and allow users to specify clades by refering to this number. Such a scheme is not workable when one has many input trees, however, because tere is no guarantee that the same clade (assuming it is present) will have the same number.
