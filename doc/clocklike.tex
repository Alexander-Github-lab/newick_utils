\paragraph{Making a tree clock-like}

Phylograms do not generally have aligned leaves, but it is possible to make a
tree clock-like with \luaed{} and \trim{}. Suppose we want to align all leaves
of the following tree to a depth of 7.5.

\begin{samepage}
\verbatiminput{clocklike_1_txt.cmd}
\verbatiminput{clocklike_1_txt.out}
\end{samepage}

We can't use only \trim, because some branches are too short. We have to ensure
that all branches have a depth of \emph{at least} 7.5, then cut at that depth:

\verbatiminput{clocklike_2_txt.cmd}
\verbatiminput{clocklike_2_txt.out}
