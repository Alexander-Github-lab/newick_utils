NU: the Newick Utilities
SP software: software that solves problems without suffering from worse
	problems
integrate: use in shell pipelines, scripts, or other programs
work, extra: e.g., shell wrappers that generate control files or change the
	fixed names, and other workarounds

NU are useful
  SP software is useful
  NU is SP software
    NU solve an interactivity problem
      Most tree manipulation tools are interactive
      Interactivity is a problem
        There is an automation problem inherent to interactive software
          interactive software is hard to automate
          not being automatable is a problem
            repetitions of the same task is boring and error-prone
            automation removes the boredom and some of the error risks    
        There is an integration* problem inherent to interactive software
          interactive software is hard to integrate*
          not being integrable* is a problem 
            integration allows larger apps to be built from simpler blocks
            integration allows automatic sequential operations (pipelines)
          NU do not have an interactivity problem
      NU are not interactive

    NU solve an extra work problem
      There is an 'extra work' problem with some CLI software
        some CLI software requires extra work* to integrate*
          integrating programs with fixed I/O filenames implies extra work*
          some CLI software uses fixed I/O filenames
          --
          integrating programs with control files implies extra work*
          some CLI software puts parameters in control files
        extra work is a problem
          extra work takes time
          extra work is error-prone
          extra work means more code
      NU do not require extra work*
        NU does not use control files not fixed I/O filenames
        Programs that don't use fixed I/O filenames, etc require no extra work
    NU perform correctly
