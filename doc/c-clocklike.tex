\subsection{Making a tree clock-like}

Phylograms do not generally have aligned leaves, but it is possible to make a
tree clock-like with \luaed{} and \trim{}. Suppose we want to align all leaves
of the following tree to a depth of 7.5.

\txtCmdOutput{clocklike_1}


We can't use only \trim, because some branches are too short. We have to ensure
that all branches have a depth of {\em at least} 7.5, then cut at that depth:

\txtCmdOutput{clocklike_2}
