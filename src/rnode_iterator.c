 * hash). At every call, it traverses the current node's children list until if
 * finds at child it has not seen. This takes O(n) time, for n children. Since
 * this function will be called once per child, the result is O(nÂ²). This could
 * be improved by "remembering" the last list_elem visited in the children
 * list. Since this has a pointer to the next element, getting the next
 * unvisited child takes constant time. There just needs to be a stack of
 * "remembered" list_elem structures in struct rnode_iterator (instead of the
 * hash, which has the added benefit of using up less space). When going down
 * to a child, the current list_elem is pushed on the stack, and it is popped
 * out of it when going back up. */
